# Computer Vision Algorithm Research Test

## Overview
This project is designed to evaluate and compare the performance of different machine learning algorithms on the **Caltech-101 dataset**. The research is conducted using **Google Colab** and implemented in **Python**.

## Algorithms Tested
We will test and compare the following four algorithms:
- **K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Random Forest**
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**

## Dataset
- **Caltech-101 Dataset** is used for this research.
- **Data Split:** 90% of the dataset is used for training, and 10% is used for testing.

## Experiment Setup
- Each algorithm undergoes **three trials** to ensure reliable performance metrics.
- Performance evaluation is based on:
  - **Average accuracy** per algorithm.
  - **Average time taken** to process the dataset per algorithm.

## Technologies Used
- **Google Colab** for cloud-based execution.
- **Python** for implementation.
- **Machine Learning Libraries** (e.g., Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch).

## Results and Analysis
The results of this research will be based on:
- Comparing the accuracy and efficiency of each algorithm.
- Identifying the most suitable algorithm for the **Caltech-101 dataset**.
